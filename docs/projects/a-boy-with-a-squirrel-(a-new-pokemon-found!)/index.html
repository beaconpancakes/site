    &lt;p&gt;I must admit that my main goal here was to draw a kid and to include in the background some of the gorgeous leaves of the &lt;strong&gt;Japanese maple tree&lt;/strong&gt; which grows right outside my window. It has been cheering me up since it started to sprout (we moved here in autumn, and it was already leafless). Its colors are stunning, it has the perfect gradient between reds and greens, and I love how the sun brights through all the foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since it was an Asian tree, I decided to make everything from there in the drawing. I also decided to add a &lt;strong&gt;Japanese dwarf flying squirrel&lt;/strong&gt;. They are ridiculously cute animals and small enough to be on the shoulder of the boy. I started to work with the line and experimented a little bit with some manga-style brushes. It was at that moment when I thought that the drawing could be something else. The palette I had in mind, the boy, the adorable animal... Wait a moment! I remembered having read somewhere that these flying squirrels look like Pokémon! That was what was missing! It was my version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I have all the details clear, and the line satisfied me, I started to work on the colors. I had to balance everything with the reds in the background, and it has to be on the outside, so I put one strong light on the top with a nice bluish shadow. The rest of the color palette was inspired by the original outfit of the Pokémon anime main character, &lt;strong&gt;Ash Ketchum&lt;/strong&gt;. Almost everything was easy to colorize; I had a terrible laborious and tedious time with the leaves, though. That was because they were more complex than they seem. But when I ended them, everything looks much better.  I added the marker from the smartphone, and the drawing felt ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to adjust the colors and the lights a lot, but I like the result. It is a little bit dramatic, but also bright and vibrant. And I think is funny as a redesign or tribute to the original series!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

          <h3>A boy with a squirrel (a new Pokemon found!)</h3>
          <p>In this new drawing, you can see a young boy with a cute shining animal that <em>maybe</em> resembles something... Well, yes! I attempted to create my version of a <strong>Pokémon</strong> trainer!</p>
<p>I must admit that my main goal here was to draw a kid and to include in the background some of the gorgeous leaves of the <strong>Japanese maple tree</strong> which grows right outside my window.
