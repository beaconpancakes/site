And I remembered that I had been not so much ago in a good restaurant wich mix Asiatic and Spanish food. The fact I remember most was a ramen dish served in an incredibly cute pig bowl! I already had my model!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a way, it was similar to the taiyaki, but it has more textures, more polygons and more complexity. I always prefer to maintain the model low poly so, for me, the hand-painted textures are the best way. And it is also the way I enjoy the more! These textures were challenging because I wanted them to differentiate from each other but preserving unity. This allowed me to experiment with the materials of &lt;strong&gt;Blender&lt;/strong&gt; and to learn more about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am happy with the results and I hope I could get all the cuteness from the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
