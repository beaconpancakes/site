And soon enough, I remembered that I had been to a good restaurant which fusion Asiatic and Spanish food. The most memorable dish was a ramen dish served in an incredibly adorable pig bowl!

    &lt;p&gt;In a way, it was similar to the taiyaki, but it has more textures, more polygons, and more complexity. I always prefer to maintain the model low-poly, so the &lt;strong&gt;hand-painted textures&lt;/strong&gt; are the best way for me. And it is also the way I enjoy it the more! These textures were challenging because I wanted them to differentiate from each other but preserving unity. This model allowed me to experiment with the materials of &lt;strong&gt;Blender&lt;/strong&gt; and to learn more about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am happy with the results, and I hope to get the cuteness from the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
