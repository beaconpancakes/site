    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;These are other sketches of heads! It seems that lately, I enjoy drawing them the most since this allows me to experiment and have fun at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, I wanted to do something with some more painterly aesthetic. Sometimes, I miss getting my hands dirty with physical paintings, so I enjoy imitating the textures and the freshness of the touch of the real thing. I used pastel-like and splatter-like brushes for the splashes of color and a thin pastel brush for the line to achieve these sensations. I also wanted a lot of texture for the background, as in the handmade paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started to draw, and the first head, the head of the woman, came quickly to life. I love drawing older faces because of all the wrinkles that conform to wonderful patterns of lines, lights, and shadows. At first, I constrained myself to sketch fast and lively strokes and a slight shade, but the result lacked deepness. So I added more layers of shadows, trying to be as delicate as possible. The splatters gave a nice touch to the composition and a sense of overall unity. The man&amp;#39;s head came later in an attempt to repeat the same technique and create something different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am happy with the appearance of the drawings and the texturized technique. But I need to keep drawing some more with this style!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

          <p>These are other sketches of heads! It seems that lately, I enjoy drawing them the most since this allows me to experiment and have fun at the same time.</p>
<p>This time, I wanted to do something with some more painterly aesthetic.

I used pastel-like and splatter-like brushes for the splashes of color and a thin pastel brush for the line to achieve these sensations.
