    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I have previously post sketches of this character, &lt;strong&gt;Isaac&lt;/strong&gt;, as you can see &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/projects/isaac-sketch/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Recently I found an old sketchbook with several drawings of him, and I could not help to draw him again!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is a character from an old story that my husband and I submitted into a comic contest. He was a space pirate looking for a treasure while he flees from the Crown and his ex-lover, who wants to kill him. We did not win anything, but we had a great time! More than ten years have passed, and the character and the story still attract me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I wanted to update his design and make him more futuristic. I looked for some cyberpunk references, and I found them fit perfectly in what I had imagined. I also decided to use a line-based drawing and have an unpolished colorwork to look more dynamic and work faster. The colors also have a lot of presence because I wanted to use the acid colors of the cyberpunk and contrast them with dark strokes of browns, grays, and violets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love this redesign! I hope you enjoy it too!&lt;/p&gt;
