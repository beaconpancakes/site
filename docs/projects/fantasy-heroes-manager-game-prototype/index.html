    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;These images are some of the graphics I did for a mobile game prototype working for &lt;strong&gt;Demium Games&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a fantasy-inspired game, and the idea behind it was that you manage a group of heroes, improve them and fight with other players. I worked in the UI of the game, together with a UX and Game Designer. He wanted to show a lot of data and info on the screens and still provide a beautiful and smooth experience, which was a challenge. I aimed to create an attractive but functional style, using vector work to create clean and scalable graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My job was to create the mock-ups, export the assets, and implement them in Unity 3D, attending to a responsive design that could adapt to different screen sizes. I also enjoyed working on this project with my very talented colleague &lt;strong&gt;Pablo Hernández&lt;/strong&gt;, who made some gorgeous character designs. You can check more of his work on &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://pablerchild.com/&quot;&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the company discontinued the project to prioritize another one. It was fun and challenging work, and I am happy with the results; some inspiring designs are here!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

          <h3>Fantasy Heroes Manager Game prototype</h3>
          <p>These images are some of the graphics I did for a mobile game prototype working for <strong>Demium Games</strong>. It was a fantasy-inspired game, and the idea behind it was that you manage a group of heroes, improve them and fight with other players. I worked in the UI of the game, together with a UX and Game Designer. He wanted to show a lot of data and info on the screens and still provide a beautiful and smooth experience, which was a challenge.

I also enjoyed working on this project with my very talented colleague <strong>Pablo Hernández</strong>, who made some gorgeous character designs.

<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
