    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;The first time I saw an actual capybara, I thought it would be great if I could ride in it! Since I learned to ride horses when I was a child, I have wonder how it would be to ride other animals. And the capybaras are pretty big (for a rodent) and round, and they seem peaceful enough to let me interact with them. So I love them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wanted to paint a warrior character, I remembered the capybara, and I thought it was my opportunity to make my wish come true! I just needed to make a giant capybara, and it should work fine!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I searched for image references, I decided that the warrior remembered South America since capybaras are from there. I searched for many and finally took some from &lt;strong&gt;Mapuches&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gauchos&lt;/strong&gt;, and a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Mongolians&lt;/strong&gt; (because fur is always fun to draw), trying to keep things not too complex.
    I first chose a palette with low saturation and earthy reds and browns, which later I complemented with a greenish-blue. I added more ochre tones on the way there, and then I added some blue for the complimentary tones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cutout dashes of color and the dark line counterpart work well and give an appealing cartoon mood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you like the warrior and her capybara!&lt;/p&gt;
