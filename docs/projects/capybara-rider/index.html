    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;The first time I see a real capybara, I thought to myself that it would be really great if I could ride in it! Since I learned to ride horses when I was a child, I have wonder how it would be to ride other animals. And the capybaras are so big (for a rodent) and round, and they seem peaceful enough to let me interact with them. So I love them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wanted to paint some kind of warrior, I remembered the capybara and I thought it was my opportunity to make my wish come true! I just needed to make a giant capybara and it should work fine!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was searching for references, I decided that the warrior had to have reminiscences of South America since the capybaras are from there. I searched for a lot of references and finally took some from &lt;strong&gt;Mapuches&lt;/strong&gt; and from &lt;strong&gt;Gauchos&lt;/strong&gt;, and a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Mongolians&lt;/strong&gt; (because fur is always fun to draw), trying to keep things not too much complex.
    For the colors, I first choose a palette with low saturation and earthy reds and browns, which were complemented with a greenish blue. But in the way there, I add more ochre tones and then complement with some blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cutout dashes of color and the dark line counterpart really well and gives a cartoon mood that I am happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope you like the warrior and her capybara!&lt;/p&gt;
