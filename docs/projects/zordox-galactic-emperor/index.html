It is a &lt;em&gt;foxgy&lt;/em&gt;, a creature that my husband and I conceived when we started dating. In Spanish, we call it &lt;em&gt;zordo&lt;/em&gt; for fox (&lt;em&gt;zorro&lt;/em&gt;) and piggy (&lt;em&gt;cerdo&lt;/em&gt;). I love this animal so much that I put it even on my &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/projects/my-wedding-merchandising/&quot;&gt;wedding merchandise&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thinking of creating something new with vectors and with reds or oranges shades. And then I remember one of the stories my husband and I made some years ago about a baby foxgy called &lt;strong&gt;Zordox&lt;/strong&gt;. He is a space conqueror despite his age and, eventually, he will become the Galactic Emperor! It is an adorable character and is very funny to make creatures with vectors, so I started right there with &lt;strong&gt;Illustrator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, in the middle of the process, vectors became more complex than I thought. I had so many shapes and gradients to keep in mind that I started to have problems with global lighting. To fix that, when I finished the vectors, I put them on &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt; and made the lighting there. I also added more complexity to the reflections and the shadows, creating a better blending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am satisfied with the drawing because I love the final colors and all the textures work. I hope you like it too!&lt;/p&gt;

          <h3>Zordox, Galactic Emperor</h3>
          <p>Maybe, some of you may have noticed a strange animal in this portfolio: a mix between a fox and a piggy with wings. It is a <em>foxgy</em>, a creature that my husband and I conceived when we started dating. In Spanish, we call it <em>zordo</em> for fox (<em>zorro</em>) and piggy (<em>cerdo</em>). I love this animal so much that I put it even on my <a href="/projects/my-wedding-merchandising/">wedding merchandise</a>!</p>
<p>I was thinking of creating something new with vectors and with reds or oranges shades. And then I remember one of the stories my husband and I made some years ago about a baby foxgy called <strong>Zordox</strong>. He is a space conqueror despite his age and, eventually, he will become the Galactic Emperor! It is an adorable character and is very funny to make creatures with vectors, so I started right there with <strong>Illustrator</strong>.</p>
<p>However, in the middle of the process, vectors became more complex than I thought. I had so many shapes and gradients to keep in mind that I started to have problems with global lighting. To fix that, when I finished the vectors, I put them on <strong>Photoshop</strong> and made the lighting there. I also added more complexity to the reflections and the shadows, creating a better blending.</p>
<p>I am satisfied with the drawing because I love the final colors and all the textures work. I hope you like it too!</p>
