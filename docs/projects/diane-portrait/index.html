    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! It has been a long time since I published something here. I have been traveling and busy with some commitments, so I had not much free time to enjoy drawing something for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had some free time, and I decided to draw a little bit, with nothing determined in my mind. I just started to make strokes with the last brush I used in &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;, a dry media one, and a portrait started to appear. It was simple, cartoon-like. I sketched the basis, and then I thought to go further until I got bored. I searched for a good brush for the line and found a pretty nice one, which led me to want more. Then I started with a rudimentary AO, got it more complex, added some shadows and ambiance, then the retouches, keeping some of the textures, and...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, a couple of hours have passed in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to call her &lt;strong&gt;Diane&lt;/strong&gt; since it sounded like a proper name for her. I enjoyed working on her portrait very much because I could work very fast and still give a nice touch with the textures and the lighting. The colors were easy, except for the hair (I love and fear equally coloring blonde hair, so I try to practice it a lot!). And I am especially fond of the harsh and grainy lines!  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
