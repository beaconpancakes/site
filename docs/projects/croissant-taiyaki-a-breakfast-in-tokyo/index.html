    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have seen many 3D artists making beautiful food models, so I thought I could do my models too! But I wanted to model something real, with significance to me, not a plain good-looking model. I had to do it! I reviewed some of my photographs looking for inspiration, and I found what I wanted, checking some made in Tokyo. It was a &lt;strong&gt;croissant taiyaki&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;matcha latte&lt;/strong&gt; for breakfast! The taiyaki was a funny and lovely treat, and the colors mixture of golden orange dough and green tea was gorgeous. Also, there was plenty of textures for the contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely, I had a great time with this model! I created it with &lt;strong&gt;Blender&lt;/strong&gt; because I wanted something fast and good material performance, so I opted for a low-poly model. I enjoyed especially doing the hand-painted texture for the fish! It was also a chance for me to do more 3D art, apart from all my 2D work with the textures, that I am more used to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

          <h3>Croissant Taiyaki - A breakfast in Tokyo</h3>
          <p>Lately, I have seen many 3D artists making beautiful food models, so I thought I could do my models too! But I wanted to model something real, with significance to me, not a plain good-looking model. I had to do it! I reviewed some of my photographs looking for inspiration, and I found what I wanted, checking some made in Tokyo. It was a <strong>croissant taiyaki</strong> with a <strong>matcha latte</strong> for breakfast! The taiyaki was a funny and lovely treat, and the colors mixture of golden orange dough and green tea was gorgeous. Also, there was plenty of textures for the contrast.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I had a great time with this model! I created it with <strong>Blender</strong> because I wanted something fast and good material performance, so I opted for a low-poly model. I enjoyed especially doing the hand-painted texture for the fish! It was also a chance for me to do more 3D art, apart from all my 2D work with the textures, that I am more used to work.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
