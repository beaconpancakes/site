    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like the previous &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/projects/fantasy-heroes-manager-game-prototype/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, these images are part of the UI work I did for &lt;strong&gt;Demium Games&lt;/strong&gt; and their mobile game called &lt;strong&gt;Quest 4 Fuel&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a &lt;strong&gt;Mad Max movie-inspired game&lt;/strong&gt;, where you led a group of warriors in their vehicles in the fighting for more fuel in a post-apocalyptic world. It was a fascinating concept, and we counted on superb art and exceptional artists and programmers. My main goal was to create a beautiful and functional UI. Since there was already a clear art direction, I had to adapt to that style, and I oriented all the art to look like a mix between clean vectors and a handpainted style. I was very interested in using vectors like the previous one because of the cleanliness and scalability. I also wanted some innovation, so I chose to use a lot of hand-drawing, transparency, and gradients.    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in the previous game, my job was to create the mock-ups, export the assets, and implement them in Unity 3D, attending to a responsive design that could adapt to different screen sizes. I had the pleasure to work here with the incredibly gifted &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Caballero&lt;/strong&gt;, who made all the stunning art for the characters and settled all the world&amp;#39;s ideas. Also, I could work with the outstanding &lt;strong&gt;Pablo Hernández&lt;/strong&gt;, who helped with the animations and the implementation. You can check more of their work here, &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.artstation.com/dcaballero&quot;&gt;Daniel&amp;#39;s Artstation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://pablerchild.com/&quot;&gt;Pablo&amp;#39;s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I ended my collaboration with the company, they continued developing the game. I just collaborated in the early stages and enjoyed prototyping a lot (I even did some simple animations). I was very proud of the UI work, and I hope it helped make a better game in future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

          <h3>Quest 4 Fuel Game UI</h3>
          <p>Like the previous <a href="/projects/fantasy-heroes-manager-game-prototype/">project</a>, these images are part of the UI work I did for <strong>Demium Games</strong> and their mobile game called <strong>Quest 4 Fuel</strong>. </p>
<p>It was a <strong>Mad Max movie-inspired game</strong>, where you led a group of warriors in their vehicles in the fighting for more fuel in a post-apocalyptic world. It was a fascinating concept, and we counted on superb art and exceptional artists and programmers. My main goal was to create a beautiful and functional UI. Since there was already a clear art direction, I had to adapt to that style, and I oriented all the art to look like a mix between clean vectors and a handpainted style. I was very interested in using vectors like the previous one because of the cleanliness and scalability. I also wanted some innovation, so I chose to use a lot of hand-drawing, transparency, and gradients.    </p>
<p>As in the previous game, my job was to create the mock-ups, export the assets, and implement them in Unity 3D, attending to a responsive design that could adapt to different screen sizes. I had the pleasure to work here with the incredibly gifted <strong>Daniel Caballero</strong>, who made all the stunning art for the characters and settled all the world&#39;s ideas.
