When I finished the **Croissant Taiyaki** (that you could see [here](/projects/croissant-taiyaki-a-breakfast-in-tokyo/)), I soon started to look for another cute food to model. And soon enough, I remembered that I had been to a good restaurant which fusion Asiatic and Spanish food. The most memorable dish was a ramen dish served in an incredibly adorable pig bowl! I already had my model!

In a way, it was similar to the taiyaki, but it has more textures, more polygons, and more complexity. I always prefer to maintain the model low-poly, so the **hand-painted textures** are the best way for me. And it is also the way I enjoy it the more! These textures were challenging because I wanted them to differentiate from each other but preserving unity. This model allowed me to experiment with the materials of **Blender** and to learn more about them.

I am happy with the results, and I hope to get the cuteness from the real thing!
