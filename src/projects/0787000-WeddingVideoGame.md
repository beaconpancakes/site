I got married last March after thirteen happy years together with my partner. When we started with the organization, we thought it would be awesome to make a video game about ourselves!

We had worked together previously in a small web game project, and we already knew the workflows. Since the beginning, we wanted to keep everything simple and functional, and we both wanted a retro aesthetic that we could implement efficiently. The game had to have enemies, (like the difficulties of any relationship..., they ended as little poos) and had to show the places where we had lived (finally we only had time to put one city, Madrid, where we currently live).

I did all the graphics and animations, with **Photoshop** and **Illustrator**, and used **Texture Packer** for the spreadsheets.  I love pixel art, and I am proud of the final graphics and the pixelated animations. It was tons of fun to do everything, and our guests enjoyed it a lot! If you are curious, you could play it on our [wedding website] (https://pinkotters.com/).

Hope you have a great time!
