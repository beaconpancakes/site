I got married last March after thirteen happy years together with my partner. We thought it would be awesome to make a video game about ourselves when we started with the organization!

We had worked together previously on a small web game project, and we already knew the workflows. Since the beginning, we wanted to keep everything functional and straightforward, and we both wanted a retro aesthetic that we could implement efficiently. The game had to have enemies (like the difficulties of any relationship..., they ended as little poos) and had to show the places where we had lived (finally we only had time to put one city, Madrid, where we currently live).

I did all the graphics and animations with **Photoshop** and **Illustrator** and used **Texture Packer** for the spreadsheets.  I love pixel art, and I am proud of the final graphics and pixelated animations. It was tons of fun to do everything, and our guests enjoyed it a lot! If you are curious, you could play it on our [wedding website](https://pinkotters.com/).

I hope you have a great time with our game!
