This drawing is a quick study of rocks and vegetation found north of my hometown, Madrid, close to the mountains. I wanted to draw an environment quickly, so I decided to use a familiar landscape. There is a place called **La Pedriza** that has fascinating and remarkable granite rock formations. These stones also have unusual colors for granite, like orange, which combines beautifully with the dark green of the pines and the yellow of the dried summer grass.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Pedriza) you can found more information about this place.

I hope you like it.
