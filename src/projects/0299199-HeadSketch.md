These are other sketches of heads! It seems that lately, I enjoy drawing them the most since this allows me to experiment and have fun at the same time.

This time, I wanted to do something with some more painterly aesthetic. Sometimes, I miss getting my hands dirty with physical paintings, so I enjoy imitating the textures and the freshness of the touch of the real thing. I used pastel-like and splatter-like brushes for the splashes of color and a thin pastel brush for the line to achieve these sensations. I also wanted a lot of texture for the background, as in the handmade paper.

I started to draw, and the first head, the head of the woman, came quickly to life. I love drawing older faces because of all the wrinkles that conform to wonderful patterns of lines, lights, and shadows. At first, I constrained myself to sketch fast and lively strokes and a slight shade, but the result lacked deepness. So I added more layers of shadows, trying to be as delicate as possible. The splatters gave a nice touch to the composition and a sense of overall unity. The man's head came later in an attempt to repeat the same technique and create something different.

I am happy with the appearance of the drawings and the texturized technique. But I need to keep drawing some more with this style!

I hope you enjoy it!
