I have previously post sketches of this character, **Isaac**, as you can see [here](/projects/isaac-sketch/). Recently I found an old sketchbook with several drawings of him, and I could not help to draw him again!

He is a character from an old story that my husband and I submitted into a comic contest. He was a space pirate looking for a treasure while he flees both from the Crown and his ex-lover, who wants to kill him. We did not win anything, but we had a great time! In fact, it has passed more than ten years, and the character and the story still attract me.

This time I wanted to update his design and make him more futuristic. I looked for some cyberpunk references and I found them fit perfectly in what I had imagined. I also decided to use a line-based drawing and to have an unpolished colourwork to look more dynamic and to work faster. The colours also have a lot of presence, because I wanted to use the acid colours of the cyberpunk and contrast them with dark strokes of browns, grays and violets.

I love this redesign, I hope you enjoy it too!
