As I wrote in the previous entry, I recently got married! But, aside from the lovely video game, I also did a lot of design work for printing!

First of all, I designed the menus for lunch and dinner and the signage to help the guests with tips and information. I even created some little games!

We also had a photo booth, and we personalized the photo frames and the album cover with my designs.  

Of course, we also had to have welcome packs for the guests! They included a booklet with activities and games about the bride and groom (absolutely one of the best ideas!), a personalized sticker, and a personalized pin. Also, to add something sweet, cookies with illustrations printed on edible paper!

I used a combination of **Photoshop**, **Illustrator**, and **InDesign**, where I could work well and agile. For once, it is fun to do designs for print and enjoy the drawings in physical objects! It was a large amount of work, but I think it is worth the effort.

Still, if you have more curiosity about my wedding, you can check our [wedding website] (https://pinkotters.com/).
