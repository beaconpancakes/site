Several years ago, I started a personal project called **"Taco & Burrito, A Tex-Mex Adventure"**.  I made some concepts that you can see in this portfolio (here for [Burrito](/projects/burrito-character-design/) and here for [Taco and Burrito](/projects/taco-burrito/)).

Currently, I am doing a lot of work in 3D, so I thought it would be fun to redo the character of Burrito in 3D. So I did all the process of modeling and mapping in **Autodesk 3ds Max** and also did the textures with **Photoshop**, trying to maintain the painted appearance. I posed the model with a simple biped, and that is all! It was much fun to do, and I have learned a lot in the process.
