Lately, I have seen many 3D artists making beautiful food models, so I thought I could do my models too! But I wanted to model something real, with significance to me, not a plain good-looking model. I had to do it! I reviewed some of my photographs looking for inspiration, and I found what I wanted, checking some made in Tokyo. It was a **croissant taiyaki** with a **matcha latte** for breakfast! The taiyaki was a funny and lovely treat, and the colors mixture of golden orange dough and green tea was gorgeous. Also, there was plenty of textures for the contrast.

Sincerely, I had a great time with this model! I created it with **Blender** because I wanted something fast and good material performance, so I opted for a low-poly model. I enjoyed especially doing the hand-painted texture for the fish! It was also a chance for me to do more 3D art, apart from all my 2D work with the textures, that I am more used to work.

I hope you enjoy it!
