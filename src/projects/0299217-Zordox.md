Maybe, some of you may have noticed a strange animal in this portfolio: a mix between a fox and a piggy with wings. It is a *foxgy*, a creature that my husband and I conceived when we started dating. In Spanish, we call it *zordo* for fox (*zorro*) and piggy (*cerdo*). I love this animal so much that I put it even on my [wedding merchandise](/projects/my-wedding-merchandising/)!

I was thinking of creating something new with vectors and with reds or oranges shades. And then I remember one of the stories my husband and I made some years ago about a baby foxgy called **Zordox**. He is a space conqueror despite his age and, eventually, he will become the Galactic Emperor! It is an adorable character and is very funny to make creatures with vectors, so I started right there with **Illustrator**.

However, in the middle of the process, vectors became more complex than I thought. I had so many shapes and gradients to keep in mind that I started to have problems with global lighting. To fix that, when I finished the vectors, I put them on **Photoshop** and made the lighting there. I also added more complexity to the reflections and the shadows, creating a better blending.

I am satisfied with the drawing because I love the final colors and all the textures work. I hope you like it too!
