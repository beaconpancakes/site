These images are some of the graphics I did for a mobile game prototype when I was working for **Demium Games**. It was a fantasy-inspired game, and the idea behind it was that you manage a group of heroes, improve them and fight with other players. I worked in the UI of the game, together with a UX and Game Designer. He wanted to show a lot of data and info on the screens and still provide a beautiful and smooth experience, which was a challenge. I aimed to create an attractive but functional style, using many vector work to create clean and scalable graphics.

My job was creating the mock-ups, exporting the assets, and implementing them in Unity 3D, attending to a responsive design that could adapt to different screen sizes. I also enjoyed working on this project with my very talented colleague **Pablo Hernández**, who made some gorgeous character designs. You can check more of his work on [his website](https://pablerchild.com/).

In the end, the company discontinued the project to prioritize another one. It was fun and challenging work, and I am happy with the results; there are some inspiring designs here!

I hope you enjoy it!
